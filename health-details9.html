          <h1>Fun facts:</h1>
          <p><ul>
            <li>Babies and children have a higher percentage of water than adults. When babies are born, they are about 78 percent water, but this falls to 65 percent by the age of 1 year.</li>
            <li>Fatty tissue has less water than lean tissue.üò≤</li>
            <li>Men have more water than women, as a percentage.</li>
          </ul></p>
        </div>
      </div>
        <p><h3>Benefits:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>It lubricates the joints: </b>Cartilage, which is embedded in joints and spinal discs, contains around 80% water. Long-term dehydration can reduce the ability of the joints to absorb shock, resulting in joint pain.</li>
            <li><b>It forms saliva and mucus: </b>Saliva assists in food digestion and keeps the mouth, nose, and eyes moist. Friction and damage are avoided as a result. Water also helps to keep the mouth clean. It can also help to avoid tooth decay when drunk instead of sweetened drinks.</li>
            <li><b>It delivers oxygen throughout the body: </b>Blood is more than 90% water, and it transports oxygen to all areas of the body.</li>
            <li><b>It boosts skin health and beauty: </b>The skin may become more vulnerable to skin disorders and premature wrinkling as a result of dehydration.</li>
            <li><b>It cushions the brain, spinal cord, and other sensitive tissues: </b>Dehydration can have an impact on the structure and function of the brain. It's also involved in hormone and neurotransmitter development. Dehydration for an extended period of time may cause issues with reasoning and thinking.</li>
            <li><b>It regulates body temperature: </b>Water that's stored within the middle layers of the skin involves the skin‚Äôs surface as sweat when the body heats up. because it evaporates, it cools the body. In sport. Some scientists have suggested thatTrusted Source when there's insufficient water within the body, heat storage increases and therefore the individual is a smaller amount ready to tolerate heat strain. Having tons of water within the body may reduce physical strain if heat stress occurs during exercise. However, more research is required into these effects.</li>
            <li><b>The digestive system: </b>Water is needed for proper bowel function. Dehydration can cause digestive issues, constipation, and a stomach that is too acidic. Heartburn and stomach ulcers are more likely as a result of this.</li>
            <li><b>It flushes body waste: </b>Water is needed in the processes of sweating and removal of urine and feces.</li>
            <li><b>It helps maintain blood pressure: </b>A lack of water can cause blood to become thicker, increasing blood pressure.</li>
            <li><b>The airways need it: </b>When you're dehydrated, your body restricts your airways to prevent water loss. Asthma and allergies can become worse as a result of this.</li>
            <li><b>It makes minerals and nutrients accessible: </b>These dissolve in water, which makes it possible for them to reach different parts of the body.</li>
            <li><b>It boosts performance during exercise: </b>Some scientists believe that drinking more water will help you perform better during strenuous exercise. While further research is required to confirm this, one study found that dehydration decreases efficiency in activities lasting more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Weight loss: </b>If you drink water instead of sweetened juices and sodas, you might lose weight. By generating a feeling of fullness, ‚Äúpreloading‚Äù with water before meals will help avoid overeating.</li>
            <li><b>It reduces the chance of a hangover: </b>When partying, unsweetened soda water with ice and lemon alternated with alcoholic drinks can help prevent overconsumption of alcohol.</li>
            <li><b>It prevents kidney damage: </b>The kidneys are in charge of regulating fluid in the body. Kidney stones and other problems may result from a lack of water.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h3>How to take:</h3>
          <p>The amount of water required each day varies depending on how active a person is, how much they sweat, and other factors.
            While there is no set amount of water that must be ingested each day, there is widespread consensus about what constitutes a balanced fluid intake.
            According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the average recommended daily intake of water from both food and drink is:
        <ul>
            <li>For men: Around 3.7 liters or 125 ounces</li>
            <li>For women: Around 2.7 liters or 91 ounces</li>
        </ul>
        For men, this would be about 15.5 cups, and for women, it would be just over 11 cups. However, drinks, like water, can account for about 80% of this, with food accounting for the remaining 20%.
        Times when it is most important to drink plenty of water include:
    <ul>
        <li>when you have a fever</li>
        <li>when the weather is hot</li>
        <li>if you have diarrhea and vomiting</li>
        <li>when you sweat a lot, for example, due to physical activity</li>
    </ul></p>
